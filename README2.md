I'm currently passionate about JAMstack, PWAs, Headless CMS, Nocode(the irony), Sustainability, Neural Nets, Hugo, S.E.O, Web Performance, Blogging/Vlogging/"Podgging"/Logging, Solving world problems, World Domination and Automation.
When I'm not designing and building things, you can find me binge watching videos on YouTube, writing articles, watching anime, daydreaming or gaming(rarely). But most of my days are spent working on projects, listening to LoFi/ChillHop/RainyJazz, studying or watching anime</p>
